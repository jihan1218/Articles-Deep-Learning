# Journey to AI Research Scientist
This repository contains a list of research articles and my notes on deep learning related topics. 
My current goal is to read at least three papers per week. Ultimately, it will be one paper per day. 

The source of papers:
   - [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/sota)
