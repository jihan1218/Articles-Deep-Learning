# Journey to AI Research Scientist
This repository contains a list of research articles and my notes on deep learning related topics. 
My current goal is to read at least three papers per week. Ultimately, it will be one paper per day. 

Here it begins the journey. 
First I start with the list of 100 Must-Read NLP Papers inspired by [Daniel Takashi](http://masatohagiwara.net/100-nlp-papers/)

### Machine Learning
- Avrim Blum and Tom Mitchell: [Combining Labeled and Unlabeled Data with Co-Training, 1998](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/Papers/cotrain.pdf)
- John Lafferty, Andrew McCallum, Fernando C.N. Pereira: [Conditional Random Fields: Probabilistic Models for Segmenting and Labeling Sequence Data, ICML 2001](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1162&context=cis_papers)
- Charles Sutton, Andrew McCallum: [An Introduction to Conditional Random Fields for Relational Learning](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/papers/crf-tutorial.pdf)
